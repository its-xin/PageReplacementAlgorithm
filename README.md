# Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer

This desktop application is a visual simulator for page replacement algorithms such as FIFO, LRU, and Optimal (OPT). Built with Electron, this app allows users to input a reference string and frame size, and see the algorithm play out step-by-step.

🚀 Features

- Visual representation of page replacement
- Supports FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms
- Input custom reference strings and frame sizes
- Designed for Operating Systems students and enthusiasts
